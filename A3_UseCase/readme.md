# A3 Use Case group 22

### 3A: Analyse use case
1. Goal: The goal of this use case is to give the architects and engineers a quick and easy overview of the ventilation needs in different rooms of the building.
2. Model Use (Bim Uses): This section is based on the "BIM UseCase booklet" source material page 2.
	* The use cases is cost estimation, phase planning, design coordination, Space manegement, Buidling System Analysis
	* The BIM uses is to quanitify and size of ventilation.
	* The use phases for the project would be in the planing stages.

### 3B: Propose a (design for a) tool / workflow
3. Process: The process of this use case has been modelled in a BPMN diagram. Please refer to the uploaded .svg file for this diagram.
4. description of the process: The tool / workflow works by calculating the required ventilation rate in each room based on the floor area. This works as according to DS/EN 16798 table B.6 it is possible to calculate an estimate of the ventilation need based on the floor area. There are however four different indoor classes and the ventilation rate is different according to the type of building/room, so for the code it should be implemented such that the user chooses beforehand what category and what type of building space needs to be calculated.


### 3C: Information exchange
5. Information Exchange: The information exchange is documented in the excel file: "Group22_Information_Exchange.xls". It should be noted that the some of thhe model element breakdown categories are marked in a red color, and this is meant as a  "nice to have but not nessecary". Only the IE tab has been filled out. 
6. IFC: From the information exchange sheet the following (main) elements were identified:
	* Floor construction
	* Exterior walls
	* Exterior windows
	* Exterior louvers and vents
	* Interior partition (interior walls)

The floor construction element in the Ifc format is the entity IfcSlab and this element is the primary focus point in the code as it is possible from the slabs to gather a majority of the information that is needed in order to calculate a ventilation rate. 

Exterior walls is collected from the Ifc file and the entity is called IfcWallStandardCase (or IfcWall). The walls are needed for the u-value and cardinal orientation (solar radiation).

Exterior windows is collected from the Ifc and entity is called IfcWindow. From the windows the needed information is: total u-value, g-value, size/area and cardinal orientation. 

Exterior louvers and vents are only needed if shading is used on the exterior windows and here they are not always taken from the Ifc files. It can be nessecary to get the shading coefficients according to methods from DS/EN 410.

For interior partition what is needed here are the interior wall elements from the Ifc file. Similarly to the exterior walls these are also called IfcWallStandardCase. The interior walls are mainly used to enclose the spaces and to get a volume of the rooms. They are assumed adiabatic meaning no u-value, heat transfer and such.


### 3D: Value What is the potential improvement offered by this tool?
This is the common question when developing tools and processes as an [intrapreneur]( https://hbr.org/2020/03/why-you-should-become-an-intrapreneur) in a company. You should consider the business and societal value of this tool â€“ does it save time to the company, does it make employees happier / more productive? Could it reduce material use in society?

7. Describe the business value (How does it create value for your business / employer)
	It brings a massive value boost to any business that would use this. The focus of the project is to try develop on the early design stages. It's a very big advantance to know as much as you can in the early design fase so you can impleed the information as early as possible. It's will greatly save time in the longer run that the ventilation shafts and AHU already have a easy and rough gu-esstimate.
8. Describe the societal value (How does it make the world better)
	It would save a lot of money, that could be used to plan trees. Hopefully it would make for more optimal HVAC solutions 

* N.B. If it doesn't do either of these things (ideally it should do both - don't do it!!)


### 3E: Delivery
In this assignment we will focus on the input data that you need for your final tool / workflow. 
9. Your tool/workflow: Description of how your tool / workflow would solve the use case
	It would make it easy to calculate the ventilation loads and to implement them in the early design fase.
10. Delivery: Description of how you would make the tool / workflow - what steps would you go through?
	We need to figure out how to make calculations in the code, and display them with the input.
